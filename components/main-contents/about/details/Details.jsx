        <p>Hello! My name is <span className='highlight-text'>Maruf Hossain</span> and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2018 when I was 16. Since then I am working on my goal to be a good web-developer.</p>
        <p>So I learnt so many things about web-development. And in 2019 I learnt <span className='highlight-text'>React JS & Tailwind CSS</span>. And Since then I love making web application with React. In 2021 I&apos;ve made a MERN stack e-commerce site for a client. And I learnt so many thing from that project. I also have experienced on <span className='highlight-text'>Redux</span> for making the e-commerce site.</p>
        <p>And in 2022, I learnt <span className='highlight-text'>Next JS & Typescript</span>. And my whole experience has changed. Everything is so fun to do. And after that I kept learning so many things, like shadcn/ui. This made the whole process a lot easier.</p>
